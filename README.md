It can be difficult to set up times to meet with all of your friends to play Tabletop Role-Playing-Games, like Dungeons & Dragons, especially if you are spread out over a large area. Thus, our goal was to create a system that would allow people to play TTRPGs with their friends without the need to find a time to meet in person. 

TTRPGs usually require access to a lot of resources and time to organize & combine elements of these resources into a cohesive game. It is also frustrating to sift through these physical resources and create & manage dungeons on the fly. We aimed to combat this problem by creating a system that handles some of these responsibilities, allowing players to enjoy the game.
